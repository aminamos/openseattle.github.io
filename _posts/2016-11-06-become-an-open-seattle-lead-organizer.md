Open Seattle started in January 2013. Since then we've held great events and built fun & useful projects. We've formed relationships with people in city, county, and state government, and at local community organizations and companies.

We're currently seeking a fiscal sponsor for 501(c)3 status (and will have more news about that soon), and have one other big change: we're seeking a new cohort of lead organizers.

It's time for new leadership to do new and interesting things with Open Seattle.

Almost a year ago we changed our name from Code for Seattle to Open Seattle to better reflect the diverse skills & fields involved in producing civic technology. Now we're recruiting new volunteer leadership with the intent of creating a leadership team that reflects the diversity we want to see in the participants of our events and projects. 

We encourage women of color, LGBTQIA+ folks, people of color and other underrepresented folks to apply.

We're looking for volunteers to make a one year commitment to improving Open Seattle & advancing civic technology in Seattle.

**The deadline for applications is end of day January 17.** It is not required that you have previous experience with Open Seattle. 

To learn more about the application process, visit the [lead organizer application page](https://openseattle.org/lead-organizer-application/)

Over the coming weeks we'll share more about the roles that lead organizers can take on, and other ways you can get involved.
