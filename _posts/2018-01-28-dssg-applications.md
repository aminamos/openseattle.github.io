The [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/) program at the University of Chicago is inviting applications to become fellows, mentors, and project partners for programs in Chicago, Charlotte, and Lisbon. The three-month program provides data science training in data mining, machine learning and big data, working with governments and nonprofits; with mentorship from industry and academia. Topical areas include education, health, energy, public safety, transportation, economic development and international development.

[Applications](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/faq-page/) are due January 31, 2018.

UC also offers year-round [opportunities](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu/jobs/) to become a post-doc, research assistant, data scientist, or project partner.

The UW [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/), in collaboration with the [Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative](http://cascadiadata.org/), is providing the fourth offering of its 10-week [Data Science for Social Good program](http://escience.washington.edu/dssg/) taking place from June 11 — August 17, 2018, in Seattle. The fellowship, modeled after programs at UC and [Georgia Tech](http://www.news.gatech.edu/2014/06/30/georgia-tech-uses-data-science-promote-social-good), is open to current graduate students and junior or senior undergraduate students. Accepted fellows will work on an interdisciplinary team to tackle real-world data science challenges using a range of tools and methods.

The UW Call for Proposals invites prospective project leads to submit short proposals for data-intensive research projects requiring collaboration in scalable data management, statistical analysis and machine learning, open source software development, cloud and cluster computing, and/or visualization. Projects are co-directed by the external project lead and one or more data scientists at the eScience Institute.

[Fellowship applications](http://escience.washington.edu/get-involved/incubator-programs/data-science-for-social-good/) are due February 12, 2018.

[Project proposals](http://escience.washington.edu/dssg-proposal) are due February 25, 2018.
