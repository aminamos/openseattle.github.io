It is incredibly exciting to announce that we've found a cohort of wonderful people to act as volunteer lead organizers for the next year!

You'll be hearing more from these folks over the coming weeks about the work they'll be doing with Open Seattle and ways you can get involved.

Learn more about their goals for the next year at our Feb 22 event: [https://www.meetup.com/openseattle/events/237616234/](https://www.meetup.com/openseattle/events/237616234/)

## Tiffany Chan

![Tiffany Chan](/images/organizers/tiffany.jpg) Having grown up in Seattle, I am rooted in local efforts and communities focusing on environmental and social justice issues. I value this work for it's synergistic approach in connecting local and global, convention and innovation, and diverse groups of people. Beyond this, I've also gained a reasonable list of cafes ideal for meeting up - have you ever been to The Station cafe in Beacon Hill?! This is the neighborhood that I grew up in and am a proud Seattleite from there. The "Seattle Freeze" mentality wasn't something I grew up with and I think it's helped me understand the importance of networks, especially ones that break barriers and silos. I bring this outlook to the Open Seattle community and am looking forward to building our collective impact through civic tech.
