For 2016 we have a plan for producing more tangible, recurring output from Open Seattle. Each month we'll have a 2-3 week sprint for producing small projects.

Each month, teams will declare their projects at our first event of the month at Socrata. These teams will then launch their work 2-3 weeks later at that month's Open Project Night.

We have three projects for our first sprint! Two of the projects focus on Open Seattle itself and will improve our design work and expand our organizing capacity. The third project expands on the existing projects [boundaries.seattle.io](http://boundaries.seattle.io) and [seattle-boundaries](http://github.com/openseattle/seattle-boundaries)

## Organizing comittee & docs
[Christina Montilla](https://twitter.com/mamatillla) is putting together an organizing committee and documentation for all the duties related to running Open Seattle.

## openseattle.org design changes
[Seth Vincent](https://twitter.com/sethdvincent) is working on improvements to the design of openseattle.org. Work is in development at [github.com/openseattle/style](http://github.com/openseattle/style).

You can see a demo of the in-progress work here: [openseattle.org/style](https://openseattle.org/style)

The end result of this work has two parts: openseattle.org will have a new design, and the style repo will become a styleguide and reusable css that can be repurposed for new Open Seattle project & event websites.

## More boundary file types
[Andrew Sullivan](https://twitter.com/licyeus) is adding functionality to [boundaries.seattle.io](http://boundaries.seattle.io) by adding endpoints that will provide topojson & shpfiles.

## Launch at Open Project Night
Be there on Jan. 19 for the launch of these projects, to collaborate on other work, or to hang out and meet fellow civic-minded technologists. RSVP here: [meetup.com/openseattle/events/227875136/](http://www.meetup.com/openseattle/events/227875136/)
