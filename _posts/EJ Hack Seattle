50 people gathered at Facebook on April 28-29th, 2017 for the first-ever environmental justice overnight hackathon in Seattle. They quickly organized into groups, based on ideas they had pitched the week before in a Facebook group with scaffolding from organizers. 

The following are the ideas that were built that weekend: 

1. CO2 Life cycle analysis: a database & tool that makes it easy to see—and understand—the environmental impact of products you might buy.

2. Waste Buddy: a quiz game that teaches you what to compost and recycle your waste

3. Farmer Connect: an app that connects to local farmers near you and makes it easier to shop for what’s available by listing current items.

4. Act Now!: an app to help you discover the legislative priorities for organizations you care about, and how yours align to theirs. 

5. Public Testimony Supercharge Tool: web-based, printable templates to help citizens write their public testimonies and print them to go. 

6. Carbon Footprint Calculator in Maps: a map to plot your route to your intended destination, it will calculate your carbon footprint based on the transportation mode (car, public transport, walking) chosen.

7. Automated Contacts Databasing Tool: a tool to collect sign-in sheets and business cards to make it easier to organize contacts

8. Expose: A platform to provide transparency and change perspectives on how people view companies & organizations.

With so many tech people looking to make a difference and contribute, hackathons have become a mundane way to organize snapshot collaborations with partnering organizations working daily to bring an issue to light. But grassroots organizers Tiffany Chan, Derek Hoshiko and Josh Epstein, alongside programmers Thomas Lai, Gary Wong and Alan Hsu and the team’s cheerleader Sage Miller, wanted to make sure they had enough ideas to attract people from all walks of life and that a spectacle was delivered. The event was well-represented by people of color, youth and members of LGBT community - rare demographics featured at hackathons. 

The mandate for diversity required, in one sense, assuming a strong mentor role to further bridge the connections that were made that weekend. This took the form of three one-hour symposiums themed PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE, which explored the environmental justice movement and its possibilities to cross-pollinate ideas from developers, and served as entry points to many who shared the desire to make a difference but did not know the background and culture of EJ. 

The learning curve was even higher for environmental justice advocates, who had yet to experience working directly with tech people, and translating their language into actionable programming tasks. The general ethos of the hackathon - its emphasis on rapid prototyping and design to solve everyday, large-scale problems - was unknown to many, who came back the next day and pulled their peers from other weekend activities to participate. 

Call to action: More importantly, the first environmental justice hackathon in Seattle benefits from the strong presence of civic tech groups in Seattle to spearhead efforts to scale these solutions. Now that the projects are archived, two Open Seattle organizers will work hard to connect interested teams to opportunities for continuing this work and value news of any related project that bridges the worlds of technology and climate change activism.
