The Open Seattle Civic Tech Mixer is an event for technologists, coders, data nerds, and designers to meet community organizations who are looking to get support from the tech community and launch new innovative projects.
 
Whether you want to volunteer your skills, offer your companyâ€™s services, or just find out more about where tech can help, this event is for you. We will have over 30 organizations and community groups represented tackling diverse issues in the local area.
 
These organizations are on the ground working hard to tackle the most difficult issues in our communities. We know what can be achieved with tech, but for these organizations, it is often out of reach, either through a lack of resources and expertise. This is a chance to meet these groups, find out about their stories, and offer your time, knowledge, and skills to launch a civic technological revolution in the heart of Seattle!
