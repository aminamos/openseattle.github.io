### Event Information
 
If you are a social impact organisation thinking about how tech could help your mission, or a technologist looking to use your skills for good, this event is for you.
 
Technology is a powerful tool for change that many small community focused organisations lack access to, while technologists often find it difficult to build long lasting projects without a definite end user. We are aiming to change that by creating a new culture of partnerships and dialogue between these two communities.
 
The event will kick off with presentations and advice from speakers who have been involved with successful civic technology partnerships, a chance to mix with participants and showcase your organisationâ€™s needs, plus a breakout room to talk in more detail with participants about potential projects.
